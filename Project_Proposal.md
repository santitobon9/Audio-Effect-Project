Project Topic
Audio effect plugin
Reverb and other autoeffect processing
Project Vision
Develop a command line application that takes an audio file and applies an audio filter/effect to it. A user should have the ability to apply sound effects/filters on pre recorded audio files and hear the result of those effects. The user should also be able to record their own voice or sound that is stored into an audio file. They can then apply sound effects/filters on their own recorded audio files. A potential stretch goal for this project would be to implement a GUI for the application.
Features
Record audio
The user would be able to record themselves through the system's microphone. The audio would be saved to a wav file for manipulation later in the application.
Use pre recorded audio
If the user does not want to record audio they can choose a pre recorded wav file for processing
Apply certain filters to audio files
The user will be able to select different audio effects to apply to audio files. The starting selection of effects will focus on basic audio effects like Chorus, Flangers, and Phasers. Adding more to the list like reverb effects will be added as tasks are completed.
Generate custom filters from user input
Taking arguments from the command line or GUI to generate custom user filters. This should be able to produce simple filters, while also being modular enough to support large polynomial functions.
GUI
Graphically representation of the sound wave and the effect the filter is having on the wave. Users will have controls for adding arguments for custom filters.

Concerns
Finding the right amount of work for a term project in a subject matter that we both are unfamiliar with. Our interest in the project is dual purpose. We both want an application that can manipulate audio files for use in other projects and to learn about audio processing. The hope is we can use this project as a learning experience about sound processing that will translate to other subject areas and projects.
